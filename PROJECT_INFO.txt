    EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS ASSIGNMENT
    TSP and Exam Scheduling using Genetic Algorithms
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
This package contains complete implementations of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA)
for solving two classic optimization problems:

1. Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) - Qatar Dataset (194 cities)
2. Exam Scheduling - Constraint Satisfaction Problem

Both implementations share a common EA framework and include comprehensive
visualization, analysis, and documentation.

QUICK START
-----------
1. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run both problems:
   python run_all.py

   OR run individually:
   python TSP/tsp_solver.py
   python ExamScheduling/exam_scheduler.py

3. View results:
   - PNG plots in each problem directory
   - TXT files with detailed statistics

KEY FEATURES
------------
✓ Modular EA framework (reusable for other problems)
✓ Tournament selection with elitism
✓ Problem-specific crossover and mutation operators
✓ Automatic constraint repair (exam scheduling)
✓ Comprehensive fitness tracking
✓ Publication-quality visualizations
✓ Statistical analysis and reporting
✓ Multiple mutation strategies (TSP)
✓ Adaptive operators support
✓ Well-documented code

EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM COMPONENTS
---------------------------------
Selection:     Tournament Selection (configurable size)
Crossover:     
  - TSP: Order Crossover (OX) - preserves city order
  - Exam: Uniform Crossover - with conflict repair
Mutation:      
  - TSP: Swap, Inversion, Scramble
  - Exam: Random timeslot reassignment
Elitism:       Best solutions preserved each generation
Termination:   Maximum generations (configurable)

DEFAULT PARAMETERS
------------------
TSP:
  Population: 200
  Generations: 1000
  Crossover Rate: 0.85
  Mutation Rate: 0.15
  Elitism: 5
  Tournament Size: 5

Exam Scheduling:
  Population: 150
  Generations: 500
  Crossover Rate: 0.8
  Mutation Rate: 0.2
  Elitism: 5
  Tournament Size: 5

EXPECTED RESULTS
----------------
TSP:
  - 40-60% improvement over initial random solution
  - Convergence within 500-800 generations
  - Visually reasonable tour (few crossings)
  - Total distance varies by dataset scale

Exam Scheduling:
  - Zero hard constraint violations (required)
  - 50-80% soft constraint optimization
  - Balanced distribution across timeslots
  - <5% students with consecutive exams

OUTPUTS
-------
Each problem generates:
  1. Convergence plot (PNG) - Shows fitness evolution
  2. Problem-specific plot (PNG) - Tour map or distribution
  3. Results file (TXT) - Detailed statistics and analysis

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------
Parameters can be adjusted in solver initialization:

solver = TSPSolver(
    cities=cities,
    distance_matrix=distance_matrix,
    population_size=300,    # Increase for better solutions
    generations=2000,       # More iterations
    crossover_rate=0.9,     # Higher exploitation
    mutation_rate=0.1,      # Lower exploration
    elitism_count=10,       # Preserve more elite
    tournament_size=7       # Stronger selection pressure
)

TESTING
-------
Run unit tests to verify implementation:
  python test_framework.py

Expected: All 10 tests should pass

PARAMETER COMPARISON
--------------------
Compare different configurations:
  python compare_parameters.py

Generates statistical comparison plots and reports

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Problem: Module not found
Solution: pip install numpy matplotlib

Problem: No convergence
Solution: Increase population size or generations

Problem: Slow execution  
Solution: Reduce population size or problem size
